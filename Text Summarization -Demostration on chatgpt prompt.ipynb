    "review1=\"\"\"Debutant Nahas Hidayat presents an enthralling entertainment for action movie fans. Screenwriters Adharsh Sukumaran and Shabas Rasheed expertly blend action and family drama, incorporating elements of romance, friendship, and family bonds. Sam CS's dynamic music elevates emotions, intensifying the film's impact. The music seamlessly complements various combat styles depicted in the movie, resulting in a riveting experience. Action director Anbu-Arivu captures the film's essence, choreographing an exceptional fighting movie in Malayalam that leaves audiences invigorated.Capturing the fire, energy, and intensity of action sequences in camera can prove challenging. While Alex J Pullikal's work is commendable, there are instances where the spark is missed. Editor Chamman Chacko adeptly blends visuals, but occasionally falls short of matching the story's high-energy narrative. The story's timeline is occasionally unclear due to shifts in fashion and ambiance. Was the sabbatical five or ten years long?\n",
    "Rage dominates the central theme of this action flick, set to be celebrated by the youth this festive season. The juxtaposition of glorifying anger amidst heightened youth crime due to post-COVID psycho-social impacts raises questions. From a creator's standpoint, infusing rage becomes pivotal for widespread appeal in action films. Even within a family of predominantly masculine figures exuding anger, contrasting instances emerge—mothers who weep for their children and can be manipulated in the name of love. Amid evolving gender sensitivities, the inclusion of a scene aimed at applause appears incongruous within the larger narrative.\"\"\"\n"

With lodestars as wide-ranging as The Godfather and Vada Chennai plus nearly every mass film made in the past few decades, King of Kotha soon loses its way. The violence is as gratuitous as shots of Raju or Kannan striding in slow motion are mandatory. Despite slick production values and a bunch of fine actors, King of Kotha adds little to this kind of film.\"\"\""
